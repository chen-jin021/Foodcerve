World hunger is on the rise, affecting 9.9 percent of people globally. In fact, from 2020 to 2021, the number of people who did not have access to food grew by as many as 161 million.

According to a recent studies, half a pound of food is wasted per meal in restaurants and since several restaurants overproduce, they have to throw out all the excess food at the end of the day. This method leads even an average restaurant to throw out about 100,000 pounds of trash each year and 60% of this trash is in the from of excess food.

What if this excess food was provided to charities and people in need instead of being thrown out?

## What it does
This is exactly what Foodcerve does. Foodcerve connects local restaurants to individuals and charities in the area. Using Foodcerve, restaurants can "serve" the excess food that they have at the end of the day to people who in need. The platform streamlines this process by creating a connection between restaurants and consumers directly. A restaurant can post the food that they have left and need to throw away with a location and then a person or organization that needs it can submit a request.

## How we built it
Foodcerve was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, LocalStorage API, and TensorFlow JS.

## Challenges we ran into
Initially, we had a few problems with our team. Due to a difference of timezones, it got really hard for us to code and create our project. There is also the issue of time as there's only 12 hours of hacking. But, in the end, we were able to get over the issue and make Foodcerve a reality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of being able to create so much in such a short amount of time.

## What's next for Foodcerve
In the future, Foodcerve will strengthen its user profile, incorporate the GoogleMaps API to help restaurants and people visualize the location better. We also hope to increase the effectiveness of the AI scanning module.
